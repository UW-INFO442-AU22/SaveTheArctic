            "Facts":"The Arctic Fox is one of the most endearing animals in the Tundra region. It can change its fur from a thick white to a short brown coat depending on the season. The Arctic Fox has been declining in numbers due to over hunting in some areas and the emergence of the large red fox in others. Finland, Norway, and Sweden are some of the areas where the dwindling population of Arctic foxes has been due to over hunting. The emergence of red foxes in their territory is mainly due to the diminishing ice. The red foxes have on occasion competed for the same food and on occasioni have been seen to kill their rival counterparts.",
