# Project: Save the Arctic

Team Members: Catherine Miao, Jeffrey Qiu, Yujia Si, Whitney Zhang, Yifan Zheng

## Intro about our web app:
Save the Arctic is part of the INFO 442 class project. It is a web application for helping wildlife of the Arctic that are impacted by global warming. By educating users about wildlife, providing the environmental impact of a small action, and prompting users to take quizzes after reading the information, Save the Arctic encourages its users to learn challenging issues of wildlife conservation and take sustainable actions to improve the living condition of Arctic wildlife.

## Current issue: 
Over the past century, human activities have been responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, which becomes the main contributor of global warming and thus brings a huge impact on the Arctic wildlife. Because of rapid industrialization and urbanization, the excessive amount of carbon emission has exacerbated global warming, which directly affects the wildlife in the Arctic. The loss of genetic diversity increases the risk of extinction of a population through inbreeding suppression. In addition, the amount of deleterious genetic variation could make the population vulnerable by accumulating in a small population through genetic drift.

## Our goal: 
To implement a website that encourages people to take small steps daily and help wildlife of the Arctic by mitigating the negative impacts of global warming and raising fundings for the conservation organizations.

## Features:
### P0
Education page - information about the arctic wildlifes on the front and actions users can take on the back (include the impact of that action)
“Take a quiz” button at the bottom of the page that can lead to the quiz page
Quiz page to test users if they read the card information (different points can be accumulated depends on users correctness)
Correct -> 5 points added
Wrong: show the correct answer to further educate users, 2 points added
### P1
User points & philanthropy choices page
Show how many points users have and the total amount they have donated (once users get certain points, our website will automatically donate to a chosen organization for them. No redemption needed. Total amount of how much have been donated will be shown)
provides users with various environmental organizations that they can donate to (not using the points)
links to other websites/resources about global warming
### P2
Starting page
intro / background / goals/ donation 
Sign in, Sign up (required to sign in to explore the website, will have a banner at the top saying “Sign in to Start” or other similar lines)

## MVP
Among the designed features, one of the most challenging features of our app is the pop quiz for users who have read through the learning content. This is a bit challenging to develop because we have to assign a unique ID name for each user so that each user’s response will be recorded and saved in our database. On the other hand, the points system also seems challenging, as it requires users to sign up for our website and make sure that the users are logged in so that their progress is being tracked. We would also need to implement a point redemption page for redeeming the points users have earned.
